# Visual Sorting App

Welcome to the Visual Sorting App, a Next.js project that visualizes different sorting algorithms in an engaging and interactive way. Our app mimics the Spotify UI/UX for a familiar and intuitive experience. Instead of album images, we display the visuals of various sorting algorithms at work.

## Features

- **Wide Variety of Sorting Algorithms**: From Bubble Sort to Quick Sort, traverse through an extensive list of algorithms using the 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons. Just like skipping through songs!

- **Interactive**: Users have the freedom to specify the length of the array that will be sorted. This flexibility allows for a range of complexities and different visual experiences.
